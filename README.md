# Streamlit Banking Application

A simple, secure, and interactive banking application built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. This app simulates a basic banking system where users can **sign up**, **log in**, **check their balance**, **credit/debit funds**, and **view transaction history** ‚Äî all within a user-friendly web interface.

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Use **Streamlit** to build interactive web apps in Python.
- Handle **user authentication** with password hashing (using SHA-256).
- Maintain **session state** using Streamlit to track logged-in users.
- Simulate real-world banking operations in a local or prototype environment.
